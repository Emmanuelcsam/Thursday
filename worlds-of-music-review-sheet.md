# Worlds of Music (MUS/ANTH 241) - Key Terms and Concepts

## Musical Terms and Techniques

### Texture and Structure
- **Descending/Declamatory** - Musical lines that move from higher to lower pitches; often used in vocal traditions to create dramatic effect
- **Ostinato** - A persistently repeated musical pattern or phrase
- **Heterophony** - Multiple variations of the same melody played simultaneously
- **Formulaic Composition** - Creating new content using established patterns and formulas (seen in blues, epic poetry, Irish music)
- **Call & Response** - Alternation between a leader and group respondents
- **Monophony** - Single melodic line without accompaniment
- **Polyphony** - Multiple independent melodic lines sounding simultaneously
- **Drone & Melody Lines** - Use of sustained tones underneath melodic material (prominent in Indian and Irish music)
- **Unison** - Multiple performers playing/singing the same line
- **Antiphony** - Alternation between two distinct musical groups
- **Harmonic Rhythm** - The rate at which harmonies change in a musical passage

### Performance Characteristics
- **Metrical vs. Non-Metrical** - Music with regular pulse vs. free-flowing rhythm
- **Lilting vs. Keening** - Irish vocal techniques: lilting uses nonsense syllables to imitate instrumental music; keening is a form of ritualized vocal lament
- **Jigs vs. Reels** - Jigs are in 6/8 time with triplet feel; reels are in 4/4 or 2/2
- **Rhythmic Drive** - Strong forward momentum in music, often through steady pulse
- **Tonality/Modality** - Framework of pitches and relationships that define a piece
- **Form: AABA** - Common song structure with two identical sections, contrasting section, and return
- **Polyrhythm** - Simultaneous use of contrasting rhythmic patterns
- **Improvisation** - Spontaneous creation within a traditional framework
- **Groovy** - Quality of music that compels physical response through rhythmic interest

### Instrument-Specific Concepts
- **Bodhrán** - Irish frame drum that provides rhythmic foundation
- **Saz/Bağlama** - Long-necked Turkish lute with movable frets, symbolic of both national identity and Alevi minority
- **Meend** - In Indian music, the technique of sliding between notes on the sitar
- **Orange Order** - Protestant fraternal organization in Northern Ireland with distinctive musical traditions
- **William of Orange** - Historical figure (William III) central to Protestant identity in Northern Ireland (also William of William & Mary)

## Cultural and Analytical Concepts

### Frameworks and Approaches
- **Participatory vs. Presentational** - Music made for collective involvement vs. music performed for audience
- **Ritual Specialists** - Individuals with specific roles/expertise in musical-ritual contexts
- **Marked vs. Unmarked** - What is considered "normal" vs. "other" in cultural practices
- **Work Song** - Music that coordinates collective labor and alleviates its difficulty
- **Authenticity** - Contested notion of what constitutes "real" or "genuine" musical expression
- **The Troubles** - Period of conflict in Northern Ireland between nationalist/republican (mainly Catholic) and unionist/loyalist (mainly Protestant) communities

### Scholars and Their Contributions
- **Alan Lomax** - Recorded and documented traditional music throughout the US and beyond; brought Georgia Sea Island Singers to Williamsburg
- **Nora Zeal Hurston** - African American anthropologist who worked with Lomax, documented Black folk traditions
- **Titon's Quadrants** - Jeff Titon's four-part models of music culture: 
  1. Four Elements of a Musical Performance
  2. Four Elements of Music-Culture Performance 
  3. Four Components of a Music Culture
- **Hornbostel-Sachs** - System for classifying musical instruments by how they produce sound
- **Alexander Ellis** - Created the cents system for precise measurement of musical intervals

### Central Course Themes
- **Gullah Community** - African American culture from coastal South Carolina/Georgia with strong African retentions; studied by Lomax
- **Social Life of Musical Instruments** - How instruments function as cultural objects with biographies and social significance
- **Ethnomusicology in Times of Trouble** - How music functions during periods of conflict, disaster, or social disruption
- **Studying Music Backwards** - Tracing contemporary traditions to their historical roots and influences
